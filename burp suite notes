Burp Suite: Good Tool For Vulnerability Scanning


This is a useful tool for performing vulnerability scanning on your websites or web apps.

The pen-tester may not always have the time to test every parameter of a web request, hence this automation technique aids in completing testing tasks.

After a rigorous process of penetration testing, this will invariably make the pen-tester effective and efficient in reaching his aim.

When a vulnerability is found, it has the ability to examine every aspect of the scanning process and will let you know. 

By showing you how to fix it, it will also aid you during the repair process.





Burp suite features


Proxy: Burp Proxy allows users to intercept and modify requests/responses when interacting with web applications. This how you capture the traffic mentioned earlier, as a proxy will send traffic on behalf of your browser, effectively acting as a middle-man.

Repeater: Repeater allows users to capture, modify, then resend the same request many times(hence repeater). This is useful when crafting a payload manually through trial and error, like with a SQL injection.

Intruder: Intruder allows users to spray an endpoint with requests, which is useful for brute-force attacks or to fuzz endpoints.

Decoder: Decoder allows users to either decode captured info, or encode a payload before sending to the target.

Comparer: Allows users to compare two pieces of data at the word or byte level.

Sequencer: Sequencer is useful to determine the randomness of data, such as session cookie tokens or other randomly generated data.
